# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-07-e2e-google-oauth-auth/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-07  
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Flow Requirements
- **OAuth Redirect Handling**: Playwright must follow OAuth redirects from Keycloak to Google and back
- **Dynamic URL Detection**: Handle Google OAuth URLs that change dynamically during authentication flow
- **Session State Validation**: Verify authentication completion by detecting authenticated page elements or user context
- **Cross-Domain Cookie Handling**: Ensure OAuth cookies are properly managed across domains during flow
- **Error State Detection**: Identify and handle authentication failures, timeouts, or user cancellations

### Test Environment Requirements
- **Test Account Management**: Secure storage and retrieval of Google test account credentials
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for different authentication modes (automated vs manual) per environment
- **Browser Context Isolation**: Ensure authentication state doesn't leak between test runs
- **Headless vs Headed Mode**: Support both modes with appropriate authentication handling strategies

### Performance and Reliability Requirements
- **Authentication Timeout**: 60-second timeout for complete OAuth flow completion
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient authentication failures (network, OAuth provider issues)
- **State Synchronization**: Robust waiting mechanisms for OAuth callback processing
- **Evidence Collection**: Screenshots and logs captured during authentication flow for debugging

## Approach Options

**Option A: Automated Test Credentials** 
- Pros: Fully automated testing, consistent results, no manual intervention required
- Cons: Security concerns with storing credentials, potential account lockout risks, brittle to Google security changes

**Option B: Manual Authentication with Test Waiting** (Selected)
- Pros: More secure (no stored credentials), flexible for different test scenarios, works with any Google account
- Cons: Requires manual intervention during test runs, slower execution, not suitable for CI/CD

**Option C: OAuth Token Mocking**
- Pros: No real OAuth dependency, fast execution, no credential management
- Cons: Doesn't test real authentication integration, may miss OAuth-related bugs, complex setup

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of security, reliability, and comprehensive testing. It allows real OAuth flow testing without credential security risks, making it suitable for the current testing needs while maintaining flexibility for future automation.

## Implementation Architecture

### Page Object Model Integration
```csharp
public class AuthenticationPage : BasePage
{
    public async Task<bool> HandleGoogleOAuthAsync(int timeoutMs = 60000)
    public async Task WaitForAuthenticationCompletionAsync()
    public async Task<bool> IsUserAuthenticatedAsync()
}
```

### Test Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "Mode": "Manual", // "Automated" | "Manual"  
    "Timeout": 60000,
    "RetryAttempts": 3,
    "TestAccount": {
      "Email": "test@example.com", // Only if Mode = "Automated"
      "Password": "***" // Only if Mode = "Automated"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Flow Implementation
1. **Detect Authentication Redirect**: Monitor page navigation for Keycloak â†’ Google OAuth URLs
2. **Handle OAuth Flow**: Wait for user to complete Google authentication manually
3. **Monitor Callback**: Detect OAuth callback URL and wait for application to process authentication
4. **Validate Session**: Verify authenticated state by checking for user-specific UI elements
5. **Continue Test**: Proceed with authenticated test scenario execution

## External Dependencies

- **Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit** (existing) - Core testing framework
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration** (existing) - Configuration management for test settings
- **System.Text.Json** (existing) - JSON configuration parsing

**No New Dependencies Required** - Implementation uses existing Playwright capabilities and .NET standard libraries.

## Security Considerations

### Test Account Security
- Test credentials (if used) stored in secure configuration (User Secrets, environment variables)
- No credentials committed to version control
- Separate test Google account isolated from production systems
- Regular credential rotation recommended

### OAuth Flow Security
- Tests operate in isolated browser contexts to prevent session leakage
- Authentication tokens not persisted beyond test execution
- OAuth redirects validated to prevent redirect attacks during testing

### Environment Isolation
- Test authentication flows use dedicated test Google account
- Test runs in isolated browser profiles to prevent cross-contamination
- Authentication state cleared between test runs

## Error Handling Strategy

### Authentication Failure Scenarios
- **OAuth Provider Unavailable**: Retry with exponential backoff, fail gracefully with clear error message
- **User Cancellation**: Detect cancellation and skip authentication-dependent tests
- **Timeout During Flow**: Clear error message indicating manual intervention timeout
- **Invalid Credentials**: Clear failure indication for automated credential scenarios

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic browser context reset on authentication failure
- Test suite continues with non-authenticated scenarios if possible
- Detailed logging and screenshots for authentication failure debugging
- Graceful degradation to manual authentication prompts when automated fails
