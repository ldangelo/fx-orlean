> Spec: E2E Google OAuth Authentication Handler  
> Created: 2025-08-07  
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automated Google OAuth authentication handling in Playwright E2E tests to enable comprehensive testing of user workflows that require authentication. This feature will allow tests to automatically authenticate users via Google and wait for authentication completion, enabling full end-to-end testing of the consultation booking platform.

## User Stories

### Test Automation Story

As an **E2E Test Engineer**, I want to automatically handle Google OAuth authentication during test execution, so that I can test the complete user journey from authentication through booking without manual intervention.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Test navigates to application and encounters Keycloak login page
2. Test clicks "Sign in with Google" button
3. Test handles OAuth redirect to Google authentication
4. Test automatically provides test credentials or waits for manual authentication
5. Test waits for OAuth callback and authentication completion
6. Test continues with authenticated user session to test booking workflow

### Quality Assurance Story

As a **QA Engineer**, I want E2E tests that validate the complete authenticated user experience, so that I can ensure the booking workflow works correctly for real users who authenticate via Google.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. QA runs comprehensive test suite including authentication scenarios
2. Tests handle authentication automatically or with minimal manual intervention
3. Tests validate post-authentication state and user session
4. Tests execute complete booking workflow with authenticated context
5. Tests verify authentication persistence across page navigation

## Spec Scope

1. **Google OAuth Flow Integration** - Implement Playwright handlers for Google OAuth redirect and callback flows
2. **Authentication State Management** - Detect and wait for authentication completion with session validation
3. **Test Credential Management** - Secure handling of test Google account credentials for automated authentication
4. **Session Persistence Testing** - Validate authentication session maintains across page navigation and interactions
5. **Authentication Timeout Handling** - Implement robust timeout and retry mechanisms for authentication flows

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the application's authentication implementation (Keycloak configuration)
- Testing other OAuth providers (Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) - Google only
- Implementing new authentication flows in the application
- User account management or test data provisioning beyond authentication
- Performance testing of authentication flows

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Automated E2E Tests** - P0 tests (CompleteBookingWorkflow, PaymentAuthorization, AIPartnerMatching) successfully execute with Google OAuth authentication
2. **Authentication Helper Methods** - Reusable Page Object Model methods for handling Google OAuth in any test scenario
3. **Test Configuration** - Environment-based configuration for test Google account credentials and authentication timeouts
