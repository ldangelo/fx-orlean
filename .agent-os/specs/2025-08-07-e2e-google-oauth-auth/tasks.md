  - [x] 3.5 Modify AIPartnerMatching test to include authentication handling
  - [x] 3.6 Add session persistence validation across all page object interactions
  - [x] 3.7 Verify all P0 critical tests pass with OAuth authentication integration

- [x] 4. Implement Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms  
  - [x] 4.1 Write tests for authentication timeout and error scenarios
  - [x] 4.2 Implement authentication timeout detection and graceful failure handling
  - [x] 4.3 Add retry mechanisms for transient authentication failures
  - [x] 4.4 Create authentication cancellation detection and test skipping logic
  - [x] 4.5 Implement browser context reset for authentication failure recovery
  - [x] 4.6 Add comprehensive logging and screenshot capture for authentication debugging
  - [x] 4.7 Verify all error handling tests pass with appropriate failure scenarios

- [x] 5. Create Cross-Browser Authentication Testing
  - [x] 5.1 Write tests for OAuth flow across different browser engines
  - [x] 5.2 Validate Google OAuth works correctly in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
  - [x] 5.3 Test authentication state handling consistency across browser implementations
  - [x] 5.4 Verify OAuth cookies and session management work in all supported browsers
  - [x] 5.5 Add browser-specific configuration and timeout adjustments if needed
  - [x] 5.6 Verify all cross-browser authentication tests pass

## Task Dependencies

**Task 1 → Task 2**: Authentication configuration needed for OAuth method implementation  
**Task 2 → Task 3**: Configuration management required before integrating OAuth into existing tests  
**Task 3 → Task 4**: Core OAuth integration must work before adding error handling  
**Task 4 → Task 5**: Error handling established before cross-browser testing

## Implementation Complete

✅ **Status: ALL TASKS COMPLETED** - 2025-08-08

All 5 tasks have been successfully implemented:
- **Task 1**: AuthenticationPage with comprehensive OAuth handling methods
- **Task 2**: Secure configuration management with User Secrets and environment variables  
- **Task 3**: Integration of OAuth into all P0 tests (CompleteBookingWorkflow, PaymentAuthorization, AIPartnerMatching)
- **Task 4**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms with 10 comprehensive error scenarios
- **Task 5**: Cross-browser authentication testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with browser-specific configurations

The E2E test infrastructure now supports Google OAuth authentication with:
- Manual authentication flow waiting for user login
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Session persistence validation
- Browser-specific optimizations and configurations
- Detailed logging and screenshot capture for debugging  

## Implementation Notes

### Test-Driven Development Approach
- Each major task begins with writing comprehensive tests
- Implementation follows test specifications to ensure proper coverage
- All tests must pass before moving to the next task

### Security Considerations
- No test credentials stored in version control
- User Secrets or environment variables used for any credential storage
- Browser contexts isolated to prevent session leakage
- Authentication state properly cleared between test runs

### Performance Targets
- OAuth flow completion within 60 seconds
- Authentication state detection within 5 seconds
- Browser context reset within 2 seconds
- Overall test execution time increase < 30 seconds per test

### Manual Testing Requirements
- Initial implementation uses manual authentication (user intervention)
- Automated credentials can be added in future iteration if security requirements met
- Tests should work in both headed (debugging) and headless (CI) browser modes
