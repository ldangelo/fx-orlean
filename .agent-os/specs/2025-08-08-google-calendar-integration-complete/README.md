> **Spec ID:** GCAL-001  
> **Created:** 2025-08-08  
> **Status:** Ready for Implementation  
> **Priority:** P0 - Critical MVP Blocker

## Overview

This spec package contains all documentation needed to implement complete Google Calendar integration with automatic event creation, Google Meet link generation, and comprehensive email notifications for the FX-Orleans consultation booking platform.

## Package Contents

### ðŸ“‹ Core Specification
- **[story-specification.md](./story-specification.md)** - Complete technical implementation specification

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Deliverables

**Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1)**
1. Enhanced GoogleCalendarService with Meet link generation
2. BookingCompletedEvent and related event sourcing updates  
3. Complete booking API endpoint with payment + calendar integration
4. Email service implementation with confirmation templates

**Phase 2: Enhancement & Reliability (Week 2)**  
5. Reminder notification background service
6. Session completion and payment capture integration
7. Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
8. Complete test suite (unit, integration, E2E)

## Technical Dependencies

### External Services
- **Google Calendar API** - Event creation and Meet link generation
- **Google Meet API** - Video conference link creation
- **Email Service** - SendGrid, AWS SES, or SMTP for notifications
- **Stripe** - Payment authorization and capture (existing)

### Internal Components
- **Event Store** - New booking and notification events
- **Background Services** - Reminder scheduling and processing
- **API Endpoints** - Booking completion and session management

## Success Criteria

### MVP Requirements
- âœ… Complete booking flow in <3 minutes
- âœ… Calendar events in both participant calendars within 30 seconds
- âœ… Google Meet links functional and accessible
- âœ… Confirmation emails delivered within 30 seconds
- âœ… Reminder emails sent 24h and 1h before sessions

### Quality Metrics
- **Calendar Creation Success Rate:** >98%
- **Email Delivery Rate:** >99%  
- **Booking Completion Time:** <30 seconds average
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful degradation for all failure scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Google API Quotas** - Calendar API rate limits during peak usage
2. **Email Deliverability** - Ensuring emails reach participant inboxes
3. **Payment-Calendar Sync** - Handling failures between payment and calendar creation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback mechanisms for each integration point  
- Monitoring and alerting for all critical paths
- Manual intervention workflows for edge cases

## Implementation Notes

This specification builds on existing FX-Orleans patterns:
- **Event Sourcing + CQRS** - Following established aggregate patterns
- **Wolverine HTTP** - Using existing API endpoint patterns
- **Service Integration** - Consistent with current PaymentService patterns
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive retry and fallback strategies

The implementation is designed to be:
- **Backwards Compatible** - No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **Incrementally Deployable** - Can be deployed in phases if needed
- **Thoroughly Tested** - Complete test coverage for reliability
- **Production Ready** - Includes monitoring, alerting, and error handling
