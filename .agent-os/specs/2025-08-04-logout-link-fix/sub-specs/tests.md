# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-04-logout-link-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-04
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Integration Tests

**Logout Flow Testing**
- Verify logout menu item triggers proper POST request to `/auth/logout`
- Verify successful logout terminates authentication session
- Verify user is redirected to appropriate page after logout
- Verify authentication state updates in navigation (shows "Sign In" button)
- Test logout from different pages in the application

**Authentication State Management**
- Verify session cookies are properly cleared after logout
- Verify OIDC token is properly invalidated
- Test that protected routes redirect to login after logout
- Verify user cannot access authenticated resources after logout

### Feature Tests  

**End-to-End Logout Workflow**
- User logs in through Keycloak OAuth flow
- User navigates to any authenticated page
- User clicks logout from user menu
- System properly terminates session and redirects
- User sees "Sign In" button and cannot access protected resources
- User can log in again successfully

**Cross-Browser Logout Testing**
- Test logout functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Verify JavaScript form submission works across browsers
- Test logout behavior with different cookie settings

### Mocking Requirements

- **Authentication State Provider**: Mock authentication state changes during logout
- **Navigation Manager**: Mock navigation and redirect behavior
- **JavaScript Runtime**: Mock form submission for unit tests
- **HTTP Client**: Mock POST requests to logout endpoint for component testing

## Test Scenarios

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Pre-Logout State**
   - [ ] User is authenticated and sees user menu
   - [ ] User menu contains "Logout" option
   - [ ] Debug panel shows "Status: Authenticated"

2. **Logout Action**
   - [ ] Clicking "Logout" does not result in 404 error
   - [ ] Logout triggers proper POST request to `/auth/logout`
   - [ ] No browser errors or JavaScript exceptions occur

3. **Post-Logout State**
   - [ ] User is redirected to home page or login screen
   - [ ] Navigation shows "Sign In" button instead of user menu
   - [ ] Debug panel shows "Status: Not Authenticated"
   - [ ] Session cookies are cleared from browser

4. **Session Termination Verification**
   - [ ] Attempting to access protected pages redirects to login
   - [ ] Refreshing page maintains unauthenticated state
   - [ ] User can successfully log in again

### Automated Test Requirements

- Unit tests for logout menu item click handling
- Integration tests for authentication state changes
- End-to-end tests for complete logout workflow
- Security tests to verify proper session termination

### Error Scenarios

- Test logout when network is unavailable
- Test logout when authentication token is already expired
- Test logout when Keycloak server is unreachable
- Verify graceful handling of logout failures
