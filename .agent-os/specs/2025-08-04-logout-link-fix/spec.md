## Overview

Fix the logout functionality in the user menu so that clicking "Logout" properly signs out the user and terminates their session instead of resulting in a 404 error.

## User Stories

### Authenticated User Logout

As an authenticated user, I want to click "Logout" in my user menu and be properly signed out of the application, so that my session is terminated and I'm redirected to the home page or login screen.

When a user clicks the "Logout" option in the dropdown menu, the system should properly terminate their authentication session by signing them out of both the local cookie authentication and the Keycloak OIDC provider, then redirect them to an appropriate landing page.

## Spec Scope

1. **Logout Method Fix** - Change from GET-based navigation to proper POST-based logout handling
2. **Session Termination** - Ensure proper sign-out from both cookie and OIDC authentication schemes
3. **User Experience** - Provide smooth logout flow with proper redirection
4. **Authentication State Update** - Ensure navigation updates to show "Sign In" button after logout

## Out of Scope

- Changes to Keycloak server-side logout configuration
- Single sign-out (SSO) across multiple applications
- Custom logout confirmation dialogs
- Remember me functionality changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. Clicking "Logout" successfully terminates the user session
2. User is redirected to home page or login screen after logout
3. Navigation updates to show "Sign In" button instead of user menu
4. No 404 errors when logging out
