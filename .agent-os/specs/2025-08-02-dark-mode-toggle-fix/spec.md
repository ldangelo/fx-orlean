> Spec: Dark Mode Toggle Fix
> Created: 2025-08-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the broken dark-mode/light-mode switching functionality in the Blazor UI by implementing proper theme persistence, user preference integration, and state management across the application.

## User Stories

### Theme Persistence

As a user, I want my theme preference (dark/light mode) to be remembered when I return to the application, so that I don't have to re-select my preferred theme every time I visit.

The current implementation only maintains theme state during the current session but doesn't persist across browser refreshes or new sessions.

### User Preference Integration

As an authenticated user, I want my theme preference to be saved to my user profile, so that my theme choice is consistent across all devices and browsers where I'm logged in.

Currently the theme toggle works locally but is not connected to the UserPreferences.Theme property in the backend.

### Consistent Theme State

As a user navigating between pages, I want the theme to remain consistent throughout the application, so that my experience is seamless and my eyes don't have to adjust to different color schemes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Theme State Management Service** - Create a centralized theme service to manage dark/light mode state
2. **Local Storage Persistence** - Save theme preference to browser localStorage for anonymous users
3. **User Preference Integration** - Connect theme state to UserPreferences.Theme for authenticated users
4. **State Synchronization** - Ensure theme changes are reflected immediately across all components
5. **Default Theme Handling** - Implement proper fallback to system preference or light mode

## Out of Scope

- Custom theme colors or advanced theming options
- Per-page theme overrides
- Scheduled theme switching (e.g., automatically switch based on time of day)
- Theme preview or selection beyond dark/light toggle

## Expected Deliverable

1. Theme preference persists across browser sessions for both anonymous and authenticated users
2. Dark mode toggle button correctly shows current state and switches themes immediately
3. Authenticated users have their theme preference saved to their profile and synchronized across devices
