> Spec: Login/Logout Button Authentication State Fix
> Created: 2025-08-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the authentication state detection for the login/logout button in the top navigation so that authenticated users see a "Logout" option instead of always showing "Sign In".

## User Stories

### Authenticated User Navigation

As an authenticated user, I want to see appropriate navigation options in the top toolbar, so that I can easily access my account menu and logout functionality when I'm signed in.

When a user is successfully authenticated through Keycloak OAuth, the top navigation should display a user menu with their name and logout option instead of the "Sign In" button. The authentication state should be properly detected from the Keycloak token and user claims.

### Unauthenticated User Navigation  

As an unauthenticated user, I want to see a clear "Sign In" button in the top navigation, so that I can easily access the login flow when I need to authenticate.

When a user is not authenticated, the top navigation should display a "Sign In" button that redirects to the Keycloak login flow.

## Spec Scope

1. **Authentication State Detection** - Fix the role-based authorization logic to properly detect authenticated users
2. **User Role Mapping** - Ensure Keycloak user claims are properly mapped to application roles
3. **Navigation UI Logic** - Update the AuthorizeView logic to show correct buttons based on authentication state
4. **Debug Information** - Maintain accurate debug information showing authentication state and user claims

## Out of Scope

- Changes to Keycloak configuration or OAuth flow
- New authentication features or providers
- User profile management beyond basic display
- Role-based access control for specific features

## Expected Deliverable

1. Authenticated users see a user menu with logout option instead of "Sign In" button
2. Unauthenticated users continue to see "Sign In" button
3. Authentication debug panel shows accurate role information matching the UI behavior
