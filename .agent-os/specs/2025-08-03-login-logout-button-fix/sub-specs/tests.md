# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-03-login-logout-button-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-03
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Integration Tests

**Authentication State Detection**
- Verify authenticated users see user menu instead of "Sign In" button
- Verify unauthenticated users see "Sign In" button
- Verify user name displays correctly in user menu for authenticated users
- Verify logout link is present and functional for authenticated users

**Navigation Behavior**
- Test navigation behavior with valid authentication token
- Test navigation behavior with expired/invalid token
- Test navigation behavior with no authentication token
- Verify proper redirect to login when "Sign In" is clicked

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Authentication Flow**
- User logs in through Keycloak OAuth flow
- User sees their name and logout option in navigation
- User can successfully logout and returns to unauthenticated state
- Navigation updates properly between authenticated and unauthenticated states

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- Test authentication state detection in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Verify consistent navigation behavior across browsers
- Test token persistence and navigation state after browser refresh

### Mocking Requirements

- **Keycloak OAuth Service**: Mock successful and failed authentication responses
- **JWT Token Processing**: Mock token validation and claims extraction
- **AuthenticationStateProvider**: Mock authenticated and unauthenticated states for component testing

## Test Scenarios

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Unauthenticated State**
   - [ ] Navigation shows "Sign In" button
   - [ ] Debug panel shows "Status: Not Authenticated"
   - [ ] Clicking "Sign In" redirects to Keycloak login

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Google OAuth login works through Keycloak
   - [ ] User is redirected back to application after login
   - [ ] Navigation updates to show user menu

3. **Authenticated State**
   - [ ] Navigation shows user menu with user name
   - [ ] User menu contains logout option
   - [ ] Debug panel shows "Status: Authenticated" with user details
   - [ ] User name matches authenticated identity

4. **Logout Flow**
   - [ ] Clicking logout successfully ends session
   - [ ] Navigation returns to showing "Sign In" button
   - [ ] Debug panel shows "Status: Not Authenticated"

### Automated Test Requirements

- Component tests for MainLayout authentication logic
- Integration tests for AuthenticationStateProvider behavior
- End-to-end tests for complete login/logout workflow
