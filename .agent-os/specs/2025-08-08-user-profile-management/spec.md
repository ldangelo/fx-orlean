> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive user profile editing and preferences management functionality to allow users to update their personal information, contact details, and application preferences through an intuitive interface.

## User Stories

### Profile Information Management

As a user, I want to edit my personal information (name, phone number, profile picture, address) so that my profile is accurate and up-to-date for consultations.

Currently users can view their profile information but cannot modify it through the application interface.

### Preferences Configuration

As a user, I want to configure my notification preferences, language, timezone, and theme settings so that the application works according to my preferences and needs.

The UserPreferences model exists but there's no UI to modify these settings.

### Profile Picture Management

As a user, I want to upload and update my profile picture so that partners and other users can easily identify me during consultations.

Currently the ProfilePictureUrl field exists but there's no upload functionality.

### Address Management

As a user, I want to update my address information so that location-based features and billing information are accurate.

The Address field exists in the User model but needs a proper editing interface.

## Spec Scope

1. **Profile Editing Interface** - Create a comprehensive profile editing page with form validation
2. **Preferences Management** - Build UI for managing notification, language, timezone, and theme preferences
3. **Profile Picture Upload** - Implement secure image upload with validation and storage
4. **Address Management** - Create address editing form with validation
5. **Data Validation** - Implement client and server-side validation for all profile fields
6. **Change Tracking** - Track and display when profile information was last updated
7. **Security** - Ensure users can only edit their own profiles with proper authorization

## Out of Scope

- Social media profile integration
- Advanced profile privacy settings
- Profile sharing or public profile pages
- Bulk profile import/export functionality
- Profile verification or validation workflows
- Multi-language interface (beyond preference setting)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can access a profile editing page from the main navigation
2. All user information fields can be edited with proper validation
3. Profile picture upload works with image preview and validation
4. Preferences are immediately applied when saved (theme, notifications, etc.)
5. Address information can be updated with proper formatting validation
6. Changes are persisted to the database and reflected immediately in the UI
7. Proper error handling and user feedback for all operations
