# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AWS EKS Cluster Deployment Configuration
> Created: 2025-08-17
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create comprehensive AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster configuration and deployment infrastructure for FX-Orleans platform to support scalable production deployment. This will provide Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup with Terraform, Helm charts, AWS-native monitoring, and CI/CD pipeline integration for reliable platform operations on AWS.

## User Stories

### DevOps Engineer - AWS EKS Cluster Provisioning

As a DevOps engineer, I want to provision a complete AWS EKS cluster with VPC, subnets, and security groups using Terraform, so that I can quickly deploy FX-Orleans in any AWS environment (development, staging, production).

The deployment should include EKS cluster creation, VPC networking setup, EBS/EFS storage configuration, AWS Load Balancer Controller, monitoring stack (CloudWatch/Prometheus/Grafana), logging (CloudWatch Logs), and IAM security policies. All infrastructure should be defined as Terraform code and version-controlled.

### Platform Administrator - Application Deployment on EKS

As a platform administrator, I want to deploy FX-Orleans applications using Helm charts with AWS-specific configurations, so that I can manage multiple environments consistently and perform zero-downtime deployments leveraging AWS services.

The system should support rolling updates, blue-green deployments with AWS ALB, automatic rollbacks on failure, EKS health checks, AWS Secrets Manager integration, and RDS for PostgreSQL. All deployments should be auditable and reversible using AWS CloudTrail.

### Site Reliability Engineer - AWS-Native Operations & Monitoring

As an SRE, I want comprehensive monitoring using AWS CloudWatch, Container Insights, and Prometheus configured automatically, so that I can maintain system reliability and quickly diagnose issues using AWS-native tools.

The monitoring stack should include CloudWatch metrics, Container Insights for EKS, distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch log aggregation, CloudWatch alarms, and Grafana dashboards for application performance, EKS cluster health, and business metrics.

## Spec Scope

1. **AWS EKS Cluster Configuration** - Terraform Infrastructure as Code for EKS cluster, VPC, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles
2. **Helm Chart Development** - Complete Helm charts for EventServer, Blazor frontend, RDS PostgreSQL, AWS ALB ingress, and supporting services
3. **AWS-Native Monitoring Stack** - CloudWatch Container Insights, Prometheus on EKS, Grafana, AWS X-Ray integration with custom dashboards and alarms
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** - GitHub Actions workflows with AWS OIDC for automated deployment and testing to EKS
5. **AWS Security & Networking** - VPC security groups, IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts), AWS Secrets Manager, ACM certificates, and ALB configuration

## Out of Scope

- Multi-region deployment strategies (focus on single AWS region initially)
- Advanced service mesh features beyond ALB ingress and basic security
- Database migration tooling from existing systems (focus on fresh RDS deployments)
- Advanced AWS cost optimization features (basic resource tagging only)
- Disaster recovery across AWS regions

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete AWS EKS cluster can be provisioned from Terraform configuration in under 30 minutes
2. FX-Orleans application stack can be deployed via Helm commands with AWS-specific values and integrations
3. CloudWatch dashboards display application and infrastructure metrics with alarms configured for critical EKS and application issues
