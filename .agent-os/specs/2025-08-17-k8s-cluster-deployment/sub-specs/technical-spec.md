# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-17-k8s-cluster-deployment/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-17
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### AWS Infrastructure Requirements
- **EKS Cluster**: Kubernetes 1.28+ with managed node groups (t3.medium minimum, t3.large recommended)
- **VPC Configuration**: Dedicated VPC with public/private subnets across 3 AZs for high availability
- **Storage**: EBS CSI driver for persistent volumes, EFS for shared storage
- **Networking**: AWS Load Balancer Controller for ALB/NLB provisioning
- **Security**: IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) for pod-level AWS permissions

### Application Deployment Requirements
- **Container Registry**: AWS ECR for storing application images
- **Database**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with backup and encryption enabled
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration via External Secrets Operator
- **TLS Certificates**: AWS Certificate Manager with automatic certificate provisioning
- **Ingress**: AWS Application Load Balancer with SSL termination

### Monitoring and Observability Requirements
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch Container Insights + Prometheus for custom metrics
- **Logging**: CloudWatch Logs with structured log shipping from all pods
- **Tracing**: AWS X-Ray integration for distributed tracing
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch Alarms with SNS notifications for critical events
- **Dashboards**: Grafana deployment with pre-configured AWS and application dashboards

## Approach Options

**Option A: EKS with Fargate**
- Pros: Serverless compute, no node management, automatic scaling, better security isolation
- Cons: Higher cost per workload, limitations on persistent storage, cold start latency

**Option B: EKS with Managed Node Groups** (Selected)
- Pros: Cost-effective, full Kubernetes features, persistent storage support, predictable performance
- Cons: Node management overhead, security patching responsibility, capacity planning required

**Option C: EKS with Self-Managed Nodes**
- Pros: Maximum control and customization, cost optimization potential
- Cons: High operational overhead, security management complexity, longer setup time

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of cost, performance, and operational simplicity for FX-Orleans. Managed node groups give us full Kubernetes capabilities while reducing operational overhead compared to self-managed nodes.

## External Dependencies

### Infrastructure Tools
- **Terraform** (>= 1.6.0) - Infrastructure as Code for AWS resource provisioning
- **Justification:** Industry standard IaC tool with excellent AWS provider support and state management

- **AWS CLI** (>= 2.0) - Command line interface for AWS operations
- **Justification:** Required for authentication and manual AWS operations during setup

- **kubectl** (>= 1.28) - Kubernetes command line tool
- **Justification:** Essential for Kubernetes cluster management and troubleshooting

### Deployment Tools
- **Helm** (>= 3.12) - Kubernetes package manager for application deployment
- **Justification:** De facto standard for Kubernetes application packaging and deployment

- **External Secrets Operator** (>= 0.9.0) - Integration with AWS Secrets Manager
- **Justification:** Secure secret management without storing secrets in Git or Helm values

### Monitoring Stack
- **kube-prometheus-stack** (>= 51.0.0) - Complete Prometheus and Grafana deployment
- **Justification:** Comprehensive monitoring solution with pre-built Kubernetes dashboards

- **aws-load-balancer-controller** (>= 2.6.0) - AWS ALB/NLB integration
- **Justification:** Required for proper AWS load balancer integration with Kubernetes services

- **cluster-autoscaler** (>= 1.28.0) - Automatic node scaling based on pod demand
- **Justification:** Cost optimization through automatic scaling of worker nodes

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated deployment pipeline
- **Justification:** Already integrated with existing development workflow, excellent AWS integration

- **AWS OIDC Provider** - Secure authentication for GitHub Actions
- **Justification:** Eliminates need for long-lived AWS credentials in CI/CD pipeline
